# How Banks, Money Market funds and Hedge funds work

## Banks
##### **How they work**
Banks are financial institutions that accept deposits from the public and make loans to them. They make money by charging higher interest rates on loans than they do on deposits. Banks are regulated by the government and are required to keep a certain percentage of their deposits as reserves, implying that they cannot lend out all of their funds. Other services provided by banks include credit cards, wealth management, insurance, and business banking. Banks contribute significantly to the economy by facilitating the flow of money and credit between individuals and businesses.

##### **Banks earning revenue**
Banks primarily profit from loan interest and fees charged to their customers. Banks lend money from deposit accounts to other people or businesses. In exchange, the bank receives interest payments from borrowers on those loans. Part of that interest is then returned in the form of interest to the original deposit account holder. These fees may be associated with specific products, such as bank accounts, or with financial services. An investment bank, for example, that provides portfolio management to investors may charge a fee for that service. Alternatively, when granting a mortgage loan to a homebuyer, a bank may charge an origination fee.

## Money Market funds
##### **How they work**
Money market mutual funds invest in short-term debt securities such as treasury bills, commercial paper, and certificates of deposit. They intend to offer investors a low-risk way to earn interest income while preserving their principal. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulates money market funds, which must adhere to strict rules regarding the quality, maturity, and diversification of their holdings. Money market funds are not guaranteed to return their original value because they are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or any other government agency. They do, however, typically maintain a stable net asset value (NAV) of $1 per share and attempt to avoid losses due to credit, market, or liquidity risks.

Money market mutual funds invest in short-term debt securities such as Treasury bills, commercial paper, and certificates of deposit. They aim to provide investors with liquidity, stability, and a low-risk return. Money market funds generate revenue and profits by charging shareholders fees and earning interest on their investments. Fees are typically calculated as a percentage of the fund's net asset value (NAV), which is the sum of the fund's assets minus its liabilities. The interest is the difference between the yield on the fund's investments and the fund's expenses.

## Hedge funds
##### **How they work**
Hedge funds are alternative investment funds that pool funds from professional investors and employ various strategies to generate active returns regardless of market conditions. Hedge funds are typically run by institutional investors with greater flexibility and leverage than traditional mutual funds. Stocks, bonds, commodities, currencies, derivatives, and even private companies can be invested in by hedge funds. Hedge funds seek to reduce risk by hedging their positions, which entails taking counter-bets to balance their exposure. A hedge fund, for example, may buy some stocks that it expects to rise in value while selling short some stocks that it expects to fall in value. The hedge fund can profit from both market movements in this manner. Hedge funds charge their investors both management and performance fees. Management fees are typically a percentage of the assets under management (AUM), whereas performance fees are a percentage of the fund's profits. The 2-and-20 rule, which states that management fees should be 2% and performance fees should be 20%, is a common fee structure. Hedge funds are generally only available to accredited investors, who must meet certain income or net worth requirements. Hedge funds also face less regulation and disclosure than mutual funds, giving them greater privacy and autonomy. Hedge funds, on the other hand, face greater risks and volatility than mutual funds because they may employ complex and speculative strategies that can result in large losses or even bankruptcy.

##### **Hedge Funds earning revenue**
Hedge funds are a type of alternative investment that employ a variety of strategies to generate profits for their clients. Hedge funds typically charge higher fees than traditional investment funds, which are a significant source of revenue for them. According to Investopedia, the average fund charges a fee of 2% of assets under management per year, plus a performance fee of 20% of any returns it generates for clients above the 2% base fee. This means that hedge funds earn more money when they manage more assets and outperform the market. Hedge funds, on the other hand, face greater risks and costs than traditional funds, such as leverage, derivatives, short selling, and regulatory compliance. As a result, hedge fund revenue varies greatly depending on fund size, strategy, performance, and market conditions.
