John 4: 23, 24

#### <u>What did Jesus mean by `"...when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth..."?`</u>
<br>

#### <u>And `"...God is spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth..."?`</u>
<br>

### `Worship in spirit`

- It connects to *`Romans 12: 1, 2`*:
    1 Therefore I urge you, brethren, by the mercies of God, *`to present your bodies a living and holy sacrifice, acceptable to God, which is your spiritual service of worship.`* 2 *`And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind`*, so that you may prove what the will of God is, that which is good and acceptable and perfect.
    
- Here we see that for you to worship in spirit you also have to be transformed by the renewal of your Mind. And you renew your mind by meditating on the Word of God
    

> `NB:Key things to consider before deciding to be Jesus' follower`
> 
> - Meaning Worshiping in Spirit is sacrificing your body. (Like 14:26, 27, 33). This describes the kind of surrender we should have. And that we should also consider and really think about what it takes to be Jesus' disciple (follower).

### `and in Truth`

- All worship is a response to truth, and that which is truth is contained in the Word of God.
- Jesus said to His Father *`"Thy word is truth"`* (`John 17:17`). `Psalm 119` says, *`"Thy law is truth"`* and *`"Thy word is true"`*
- To truly worship God we must understand who He is and what He has done. And one of the reliable places He has revealed Himself is in the Bible.
- Worship is an expression of praise from the depth of our hearts towards a God who is understood through His word. We know about Him in His Word. We know Him by doing what He says. (`John 15:14`) *`"You are my friends if you do what I command you"`*
- (`Matthew 25:12`) *`"But he answered, ‘Truly I say to you, I do not know you.’"`* Parable of the ten virgins. Here we see that If we don't know Jesus, we won't enter the Kindom of Heaven.
- And if we do not have the truth of the bible, we do not know God and we cannot be truly worshipers.
