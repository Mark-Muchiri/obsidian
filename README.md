## 💡 How it works

Three ideas drive the whole design:

> [!NOTE]
> **Symlinks as the source of truth.** Every config file (`~/.zshrc`, `~/.config/nvim`, etc.) is a symlink pointing into this repo. Editing a config in your editor _is_ editing the repo — no copy step, no sync-back, no drift.

> [!NOTE]
> **Git as the sync mechanism.** `sync.sh` exports GNOME settings, stages everything with `git add -A`, and pushes. Because configs are symlinked, `git diff` always shows exactly what changed.

> [!NOTE]
> **Staged, resumable automation.** `setup.sh` runs through named stages and writes each completed stage to a local state file. Interrupted? Run `bash scripts/setup.sh --resume` and it picks up exactly where it left off.

## ✅ Prerequisites

- [x] Fedora Workstation 43+
- [x] A regular user account _(not root — `setup.sh` will refuse to run as root)_
- [x] Internet connection
- [x] A GitHub account _(setup.sh will generate an SSH key if you don't have one)_

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Fresh machine

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone git@github.com:Mark-Muchiri/obsidian.git ~/repo/obsidian

# 2. Run setup
cd ~/repo/obsidian
bash scripts/setup.sh
```

> [!TIP]
> If setup asks you to restart your shell — close the terminal completely, open a new one, then run:
>
> ```bash
> bash scripts/setup.sh --resume
> ```
>
> The state machine remembers exactly where it left off.

### Restore configs on an existing machine

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Mark-Muchiri/obsidian.git ~/repo/obsidian
bash ~/repo/obsidian/scripts/restore.sh
```

## 🔄 Daily Usage

### Sync changes to GitHub

```bash
bash scripts/sync.sh   # or the alias: sync-dots
```

Here's what happens under the hood:

```mermaid

    A([Edit any config]) -->|symlink — instant| B[configs/ in repo]
    B --> C[sync-dots]
    C --> D[dconf dump]
    C --> E[git add -A]
    E --> F[git commit]
    F --> G([github.com])

    style G fill:#E6F1FB,stroke:#185FA5,color:#0C447C
```

### Verify all symlinks are intact

```bash
bash scripts/restore.sh --check
```

### Add a new config file

1. Move the file into the appropriate `configs/` subdirectory
2. Add one line to `CONFIG_MAP` in `scripts/restore.sh`
3. Run `bash scripts/restore.sh` to create the symlink
4. Run `bash scripts/sync.sh` to commit

## ⚙️ Setup flags

| Command                            | Effect                                    |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `bash scripts/setup.sh`            | Fresh install — runs all stages in order  |
| `bash scripts/setup.sh --resume`   | Skip completed stages, continue from last |
| `bash scripts/setup.sh --reset`    | Clear state and re-run all stages[^1]     |
| `bash scripts/restore.sh`          | Create all config symlinks                |
| `bash scripts/restore.sh --check`  | Verify all symlinks — no changes made     |
| `bash scripts/restore.sh --unlink` | Remove symlinks, restore any backups      |
| `bash scripts/sync.sh`             | Dump dconf + commit + push                |

[^1]: `--reset` clears the stage progress file only. It does **not** uninstall any packages or undo any system changes.

## 🔀 How sync works

All configs in `configs/` are **symlinked** — not copied — into their system locations. Editing `~/.zshrc` edits `configs/zsh/.zshrc` directly. `sync.sh` runs `git add -A`, so every config change is captured automatically with no manual copy step.

```
~/.zshrc                    →  configs/zsh/.zshrc
~/.config/nvim              →  configs/nvim/
~/.config/wezterm/wezterm.lua  →  configs/wezterm/wezterm.lua
          ︙                              ︙
     live system                    git repo  →  GitHub
```

---

## 🔍 ShellCheck

All scripts and lib modules are ShellCheck-clean. Run before every commit:

```bash
for f in lib/*.sh scripts/*.sh; do shellcheck -x -s bash "$f" && echo "✔ $f"; done
```

> [!CAUTION]
> Always pass `-x` — without it, ShellCheck cannot follow `source` directives and will report false positives on every script that sources a `lib/` module.

## 👥 For contributors and maintainers

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Read [`handout.md`](handout.md) **before making any changes.**

`handout.md` is a complete technical reference covering:

- Every design decision and the rationale behind it
- Full source of every script
- Every bug found and fixed during development
- Current known gaps (including what's untested)
- A visual stage-flow diagram of `setup.sh`

It is written so that a technical reader — or an AI assistant — can continue the project with full context and zero prior knowledge of its history.
