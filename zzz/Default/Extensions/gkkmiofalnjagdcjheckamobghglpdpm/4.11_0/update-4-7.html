        <h2>Important Update: Moving to Lifetime Access for $12 AUD</h2>
        <p>
          Based on overwhelming user feedback and requests, we're making an important change to our premium access model. We're moving from yearly subscriptions to a <strong>one-time lifetime purchase of $12 AUD</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>What's changing?</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>All existing yearly subscriptions will be automatically converted to lifetime access</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Your recurring payments will be automatically cancelled</strong></li>
          <li><strong>You'll maintain permanent access to all premium features</strong></li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="thank-you">
        <h2>Thank You to Our Early Supporters!</h2>
        <p>
          To our existing subscribers: Thank you for your early support! While new users will pay $12 AUD for lifetime access, you're being automatically upgraded to lifetime access at no additional cost. This is our way of showing appreciation for your early support and trust in our extension.
        </p>
      </div>

      <section>
        <h2>Why This Change?</h2>
        <p>
          After receiving feedback from our users, it became clear that many prefer a one-time purchase over recurring payments. This change simplifies things for everyone and ensures you have permanent access to all premium features without worrying about renewals.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although I understand that the initial yearly subscription was not a popular decision due to putting auto-toggle behind a paywall, I had to ensure that subscribers were getting the best value for their money. This should provide the best middle ground.

        <h2>Update Notes</h2>
        <p>
